This is the *Cipher Decoder* project I made myself.


<p>Cryptography is a crucial concept when some things are meant to be kept secret. One of the main issues of cryptography is how to send an encryption key to another person over an unsecured communication channel. In this project, we will take a look at the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol and apply it to keep the conversation under our hat.</p>
